# Weather-Application

Practice java script REACT!
My introduction to java script and react. 

Application functionallity:
    Basically the user enters a city and the country which it belongs to and the application will fetch from the API (https://openweathermap.org/api) the temperature, humidity and a brief description of the conditions in that location at the time. The web application will print out results for the user.
    
          
STILL NEED TO ADD CSS (to make it look pretty)
